API Tests / Load tests
=======

### test-api.js
Jenkins is king

### user-api.js


### tic-tac-toe-game-player.js : Sequential code
 
### tic-tac-toe-game-player.js : Failing load tests
After doing everything the Assigment asked me to do, and trying some strange variations the load test did not fail, so there is nothing more to do here 

### tictactoe.loadtest.js
I found out that i could finish 30 games in 1 second on my personal computer.  
And was able to finish XXX games in 1 second on my build server.
