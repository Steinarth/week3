List of things finished:

#### Completed the migrations needed for the application to work
    By using node's db-migrate, we were able to create a database migration script relatively easily.  

#### On Git push Jenkins pulls my code and the Tic Tac Toe application is deployed through a build pipeline, but only if all my tests are successful

    All good.
#### Filled out the Assignments: for the API and Load tests
    Answers here: [API and Load test assignment](apitest/Assignment.md)

#### The API and Load test run in my build pipeline on Jenkins and everything is cleaned up afterwards

    After we run startserver, and run load/api tests we kill the process.
#### My test reports are published in Jenkins

    Yes they can be found under the Latest test report link on Jenkins.
#### My Tic Tac Toe game works, two people can play a game till the end and be notified who won.
    Yes, all good.

#### My TicCell is tested
